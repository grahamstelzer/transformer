### 7/6/25 : 
Deleted license because theres really nothing licensable, the code I was going to add and change has evolved since I learned a lot more from various sources like Deepseek. I'd say this codebase currently sits at a state of "Umar Jamil's transformer code-along tutorial with a lot more comments". In the future, I will start swapping out pieces with my own code once I implement things to my own satisfaction.

umar jamils actual working: https://github.com/hkproj/pytorch-transformer,
note, definitely several steps ahead of this implementation, notably uses beam search.
